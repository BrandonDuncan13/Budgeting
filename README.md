# React Bootstrap Budgeting App
The start of a budgeting app made with React and Bootstrap which helps you categorize your expenses to keep track of your spending.
This app uses custom hooks, context, and components and allows users to add a budget with a maximum spending value, add expenses either
to an existing budget card or to an uncategorized card, view expenses belonging to a budget, and also see how much money they've spent 
within a particular budget or across all budgets.
